# Stock Data Analysis and Clustering

## Overview

This project is a web analytics tool for scraping data from Yahoo Finance to obtain key financial features of stocks. The objective is to provide insights into stock clustering based on these features and the discretized dividend rate.


## Features

- **Web Scraping**: We utilize web scraping techniques to collect financial data from Yahoo Finance, providing detailed information on a variety of stocks.

- **Interactive Tool**: We've built an interactive tool that allows users to explore and analyze stock data, evaluate feature importance, and discover relationships between stocks.

- **Stock Clustering**: The primary objective is to cluster stocks based on their financial features. These clusters are determined with the discretized dividend rate as the target variable.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: We employ techniques such as t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and Autoencoders (AE) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, aiding in visualization and clustering.

- **Graph Theory and Bayesian Analysis**: We apply graph theory and Bayesian graph analysis to construct a reduced subset of data for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification, optimizing the speed and accuracy of predictions, based on the approach proposed in ***Improving kNN multi-label classification in Prototype Selection scenarios using class proposals***, reference:

## Financial Features

1. **Forward Annual Dividend Yield**: Anticipates future dividend payments.

2. **Trailing Annual Dividend Yield**: Reflects the past year's performance.

3. **5-Year Average Dividend Yield**: Evaluates long-term dividend consistency.

4. **Payout Ratio**: Indicates dividend sustainability.

5. **Profit Margin**: Measures the ability to fund dividends with higher profits.

6. **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Evaluates efficiency in generating returns.

7. **Total Cash (mrq)**: Ensures dividend obligations can be met.

8. **Total Debt/Equity (mrq)**: Assesses financial conservatism.

9. **Operating Cash Flow (ttm)**: Vital for sustaining dividend payments.

10. **Levered Free Cash Flow (ttm)**: Manages debt for dividend distribution.

11. **Focus on Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Cash Flow, and Leverage**: These metrics are essential for maintaining a healthy financial structure.

## Development timeline

###  Scraping

The data gathering process involved two steps,
  1. Obtaining list of stock tickers (from various websites such as this one: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/, and sort them based on market cap.
  2. Simple scraping for the features which is done through Scrapy, Selenium or requests, with the appropriate url

### Dimensionality reduction

To produce a scatter plot, a dimensionality reduction scheme is needed, t-SNE (t-stochastic neighbour embedding) suffices if no inference is to be made on reduced set. Once we obtain it, produce interactive scatter plot. We will also consider topological dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP.
